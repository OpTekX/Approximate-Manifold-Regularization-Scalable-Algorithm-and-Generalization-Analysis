# Fast and Scalable Graph-Based Semi-Supervised Learning
## Supplementary file
Appendixes mentioned in the paper are attached in supplementary.pdf
## Usage of source code
Code used in experiments locates in ./code
### Enviroment
We do experiments based on following softwares:
1. MATLAB R2017b
### Data sets
1. All datasets are from https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/
### Steps
1. Download data sets into ./datasets
2. Run Test_run('madelon') to experiment all five methods on dataset madelon, and other datasets are under similar process.
